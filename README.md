# PowerNet Console
A Rimworld mod that adds a power management station to toggle powered items on your network.

Steam link: [steam workshop page](TODO://)

Non steam: See [the releases](https://github.com/BardezAnAvatar/Rimworld-PowerNetConsole/releases) to download the latest version of the mod.
I only make releases when I make many changes. For the most up-to-date version, please build the mod assemblies yourself using Visual Studio 2019+.

Fully open source: check out the 3D models, PDN files, source code and contribute!
